This repository contains a MATLAB script and stress-strain data for various polymeric foams and architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams. Upon execution, the MATLAB script prompts the user to input parameters related to the design of a protective shock absorber, such as the mass of the object to be protected, the maximum allowed acceleration, expected impact velocity, and the targeted area to be lined with the foam. Using these parameters, the script calculates the minimum achievable thickness and mass, and identifies the optimal foam material from the provided dataset to meet these requirements (Fig.1b).

As examples, we provide stress-strain responses for our VACNT foams and three different polymeric foams, which were measured experimentally. Users can also input data for other polymeric, metallic, or architected foams to design an optimal shock absorber.

Please use MATLAB version 2021 or later to execute the script properly.

The code and measured stress-strain data are original works by Thevamaran Lab, UW-Madison and are intended for scientific research purposes only. Please do not share these files on other platforms.
